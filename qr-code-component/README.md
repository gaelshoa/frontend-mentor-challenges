## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This first challenge allowed me to apply basic CSS concepts such as centering a div, using box model properties like margin and padding, importing fonts. 

### Continued development

Right now I just need to practice and do more challenges. 

### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) - The HTML and CSS chapters of their Foundations course really helped me understand the basics of CSS, especially the box model and Flexbox. 
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/drop-shadow) - I used this page to implement the drop shadow effect since I hadn't used this function before.
